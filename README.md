> Spotify, Music, Statistics, Streaming, Popularity

This project analyses musictheoretical variables, "audio features" (<a href = "http://web.media.mit.edu/~tristan/phd/dissertation/index.html"> </a>)for unsupervised learning. Artist specific information is additionally used to predict artist popularity (0,100) and whether the artist/song was a "chartbreaker" in the German Spotify market or not.
